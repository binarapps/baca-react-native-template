# Setup env variables in existing project ðŸŒˆ

## Place doppler tokens in configuration file

1. Create empty file `scripts/doppler_variables.sh` and add this script to new created file.

- run this command (this will copy template and place it in `scripts/doppler_variables.sh`)

```bash
yarn prepare:env_file
```

2. Add correct values to variables (ask one of the developers for that), example:

```bash
export DOPPLER_TOKEN_DEVELOPMENT=dp.st.alpha.XXXXxxxxXXXXxxxxXXXXxxxx
```

## Check if everything works correctly.

In project dir terminal run:

```bash
yarn generate:env:(qa/staging/production)
```

Choose the proper app version depending on the environment for which you want to generate env file.

<b>`.env`</b> file should be generated and consist of variables passed to Doppler, and some extra doppler
variables as DOPPLER_CONFIG.

CONGRATULATION !! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ You have configured the Doppler tool for your project!
