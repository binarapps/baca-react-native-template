# Colors

We are using untilted colors in the app, you can find docs here: https://www.untitledui.com/components/color-styles

Colors in [baca-react-native-template](https://github.com/binarapps/baca-react-native-template) are build around [untilted ui](https://www.untitledui.com/components/color-styles).

You can see how it looks in the app here:
