Bootstrap project structure, that is needed to start development

## **What you need to do, to start development**

---

### Step 1. Setup repository

We recommend to clone this repository and initialize it as your own repository. This will help you to get updates from this repository. Optionally you can check other options to setup repository.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine

```bash
git clone git@github.com:binarapps/baca-react-native-template.git name_of_your_app
cd name_of_your_app
```

2. Change origin to your repository

```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:organization_name/repository_name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

> Removing git history **(not recommended)**
>
> - do it only if you don't want to keep history of commits - maybe client doesn't want this
> - when you will get rid of git history it could be hard to apply changes made in the starter file
>
> ```bash
> rm -r .git
> git init
> git commit -m "chore: initialize project"
> ```

<Details title="Other options to setup repository">
1. Init using this command (be aware that sometimes this template can't be updated on npm, in that case, clone this repository and reinitialize repository for yourself - check third type of setup)

```bash
npx create-expo-app --template=@binarapps/baca-react-native-template name_of_your_app
```

2. Use this as template repo on GitHub

### Step 2. Login / register to expo

If you have expo account → go login with it

If you do not have expo account → register on your company email. In terminal type:

```bash
eas register
```

You will be redirected to expo registration page. If something is not right please make sure you have eas cli installed

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli

```

Login to expo account on your local machine.

1. login to expo cli from your project dir terminal. In terminal type:

```bash
eas login
```

2. put your username and password to your account register in step 3.

3. Check if you are correctly log in to your expo account. In terminal type:

```bash
eas whoami
```

---

### Step 3. Create project on expo.dev

1. Sign in to the expo dev console (account created in the first step of repo configuration).

2. Select the proper organization you are working for from a dropdown:

   ![Select organization](../../static/img/expo_select.jpg)

   Ideally, it will be an organization created by the client (especially for production builds), to easily pass access after the end of development.

3. Create a new Project in the organization.

   - From the sidebar menu click **All projects** button:

     ![All projects](../../static/img/expo_all.png)

   - On the page with the list of projects click **+New Project** button:

     ![New project](../../static/img/expo_new.png)

   - Apply **display name** and **slug** of your project.

     Display name is a name that will be visible in the Expo Dev Console.

     Slug is the name that will link your Expo application with your code.

     ![Project create](../../static/img/expo_create.png)

### Step 4.Sync project with code.

Please gather this data:

1. **app name** - you can add **display name** from previous step, or add anything you want here, this name will be displayed for users later
2. **slug name** - created in 1-st point.
3. **owner** - organization picked from the list in 1-st point

:::note

If you will have issues with finding this values, please check [bootstrap testing docs](/docs/bootstrap/testing)

:::

If you gather all this data please run this command:

```bash
yarn baca bootstrap --simple
```

:::warning
Please verify all changes made with the script
